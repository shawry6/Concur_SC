# [DJM_dApps](https://shawry6.github.io/DJM_dApps/)
[DJM_dApps](https://shawry6.github.io/DJM_dApps/) is suite of Smart Contracts on the Ethereum Blockchain. DJM_dApps enables members (Delegates) within any type of group (Community / Organisation) to agree (Vote) on any idea (Proposal) imaginable. The winning idea is then offered to contractors (Suppliers) to bid on (Tender). The contractor with the winning bid is then contracted by the leader/s of the group (Chairperson/s) to fulfill the works required for the idea. Each Smart Contract is secured by it's signaturies on the Ethereum Blockchain...where it lives immutably forevermore. 

Please see the [DJM_dApps](https://shawry6.github.io/DJM_dApps/) process below:  

##**1. Propose an Idea** 
* Delegates offer new Proposal/s for their Organisation

##**2. Vote for an Idea**
* Delegates vote for a Proposal

##**3. Request for Tenders to fulfill the Winning Idea**
* Request for Tender is offered by Chairperson/s to Suppliers to bid on the winning Proposal  

##**4. Vote for a Tender**
* Chairperson/s vote for a Tender to fulfill the idea

##**5. Contract the Winning Tender**
* Chairperson/s engage the winning Supplier to commence completion of the idea

## Technologies

Concur is written in the Solidity programming language and tested on the Ropsten Network. 

    Describe the technologies required to use your project such as programming languages, libraries, frameworks, and operating systems. Be sure to include the specific versions of any critical dependencies that you have used in the stable version of your project.

---

## Installation Guide

To compile and deploy Concur we used and tested with Remix and Metamask. We took data from our Bot and we provided the end user with a UI via IPFS. 

Please see code notes in the Solidity Contracts.

Note that the Voting System requires an array of strings for deployment.
