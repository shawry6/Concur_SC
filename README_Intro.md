# Concur_SC
Concur is a Smart Contract on the Ethereum Blockchain. It enables users to agree on anything imaginable. It is secured by it's signaturies on the Ethereum Blockchain...where it lives immutably forevermore.

## Technologies

Concur is written in the Solidity programming language and tested on the Ropsten Network. 

    Describe the technologies required to use your project such as programming languages, libraries, frameworks, and operating systems. Be sure to include the specific versions of any critical dependencies that you have used in the stable version of your project.

---

## Installation Guide

To compile and deploy Concur we used and tested with Remix and Metamask. We took data from our Bot and we provided the end user with a UI via IPFS. 

Please see code notes in the Solidity Contracts.

Note that the Voting System requires an array of strings for deployment.
